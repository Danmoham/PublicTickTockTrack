#Tracking App

An application that allows users to track their activities and can use generative AI to help give them an estimate time of how long this will take to create. The back-end is using Firebase and the front end uses React with a small amount of bootstrap. I have used an OpenAI API to include the AI in the application. This version of the APP is the public version so it will not run when cloned.

This is due to not having any back-end keys and the API key for the AI has been taken out of this repo for security reasons. If you wish to re-create this application, you will need to sign up to OpenAI and get your own API key and set up a backup server with firebase to host all of your data. You will need the dependencies of bootstrap, OpenAI and firebase for this to run on your local machine, please also ensure that you have Node V14 installed on your local machine.
