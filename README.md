#Tracking App

An application that allows users to track their activities and can use generative AI to help give them an estimate time of how long this will take to create. The back-end is using Firebase and the front end uses React with a small amount of bootstrap. I have used an OpenAI Api to include the AI in the application. This will be being deployed very soon.
